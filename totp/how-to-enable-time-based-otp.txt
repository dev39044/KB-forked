# Install TOTP (time-based one-time-password)
# Bellow I'll use Google TOTP

# ------------------------------- STEP 1------------------------------------

apt-get update && apt-get install libpam-google-authenticator

# Run the initialization app.

google-authenticator

Output
Do you want authentication tokens to be time-based (y/n) y

# RECORD ALL PROVIDED INFO IN PASSWORD MANAGER!
Output
Do you want me to update your "~/.google_authenticator" file (y/n) y

This writes the key and options to the .google_authenticator file. 
If you say no, the program quits and nothing is written, which means the authenticator won't work.

Output
Do you want to disallow multiple uses of the same authentication
token? This restricts you to one login about every 30s, but it increases
your chances to notice or even prevent man-in-the-middle attacks (y/n) y

Output
By default, tokens are good for 30 seconds and in order to compensate for
possible time-skew between the client and the server, we allow an extra
token before and after the current time. If you experience problems with poor
time synchronization, you can increase the window from its default
size of 1:30min to about 4min. Do you want to do so (y/n) n

Output
If the computer that you are logging into isn't hardened against brute-force
login attempts, you can enable rate-limiting for the authentication module.
By default, this limits attackers to no more than 3 login attempts every 30s.
Do you want to enable rate-limiting (y/n) y

# ------------------------------- STEP 2------------------------------------

# Open and edit below file
vi /etc/pam.d/sshd

# Comment @include common-auth in order to stop asking for password.
@include common-auth

# At the end of the file add, right after @include common-password add:
auth required pam_google_authenticator.so

# --------
# Open and edit below file
vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# Fix these options:
ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes
PasswordAuthentication no

# At the and of this file sshd_config add:
AuthenticationMethods publickey,password publickey,keyboard-interactive

# Save & restart. 
# That's it!
