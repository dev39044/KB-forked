# Here I'll describe how to set up Windows VM on Xen (Dom0) without any GUI installed on.
# It was tested on Debian 10 Buster.

# 1. We suppose you already have working Xen installation
# 2. Create lvm partitions for your new VM
# 3. You already have downloaded somewhere winXXX.ISO file, right? :)
# 4. Below I'll provide you with working configuration to put in /etc/xen/configs/
# Please verify all paths in the config file! 

# DRIVERS:
# If Xen VM Windows has missing drivers, try to install them from here:
# https://xenbits.xen.org/pvdrivers/win/
# Below config was tested on Windows Servers 2019 + drivers 8.2.2 from above link

# 
#  More info about all options  ==>  man xl.cfg
# --------------------------------------------------

# Check Xen firmware version and change path accordingly!

# Check name of your bridge iface 
	vif = ['bridge=xenbr1']

# Use this string to show from which device the vm to boot from
	# d == CR-ROM
	boot=d

# WITH CD-ROM or without
	# disk = ['phy:/dev/vg0/virtuozosys,hda,w','file:/root/win2012-eval.iso,hdc:cdrom,r']


	disk = ['phy:/dev/vg0/virtuozosys,hda,w']
