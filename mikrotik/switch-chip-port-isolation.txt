Port Isolation feature on my mikrotik RB2011 device sucks, because it's limited to a single switch chip only!
If you want to isolate, e.g. port2 from port7 - this won't work, as usually this involves 2 switch chips.
Port 1-5 = swich chip1 & ports 6-10 = switch chip2. 

You could achieve similar functionality with Bridge Filter tab.
It is like ebtables tool in Netfilter package.
E.g:

[vgroot@MikroTik-vg] /interface bridge filter> print all 
Flags: X - disabled, I - invalid, D - dynamic 
 0   chain=forward action=drop in-bridge=DMZ-br0-and-Filters log=no log-prefix=""

With this rule, you block forwarding in the bridge itself. Note that FORWARD table
is used to forward frames between ports in the bridge.

In Xen, you could do it with something like that:
Suppose that all Xen VMs have interface names starting with vif-<SOME NAME>. Well,
then on the Xen host you add rule in FORWARD ebtables table like that:

ebtables -t filter -A FORWARD -i vif+ -o vif+ -j DROP

"+" sign here is like regex and match iface starting with "vif".
So, we're actually block traffic between virtual interfaces on that Xen bridge.
More info for ebtables -> man ebtables-legacy  [ 1st install ebtables-legacy with apt-get install ebtables]

That's it.
