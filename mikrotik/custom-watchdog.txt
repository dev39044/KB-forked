# You need custom mikrotik watchdog as default one just sucks :/
# Here you can have 3 wan ips that are to be monitored as well as 
# full freedom about ping counts, delays etc...

# Note that during reboot, poe-out iface is also reset (it was tested).
# In Mikrotik world in order to see exit status of a command, try with:

:put [ command ] 

E.g:
:put [ /ping 1.1.1.1 count=2 ]

if ping is successful you will get number 2, which is the number of successfully send/received packets.
Output (exit status) depends on the command itself, and sometimes it's just a string, number or ... nothing.
In mikrotik one send/received packet is always 1 second, i.e. if you send 1 packet and it gets back for 3 ms, 
then mikrotik router waits 997ms, before sending another packet.
