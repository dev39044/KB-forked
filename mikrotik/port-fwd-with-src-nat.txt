# Let's suppose that you want to access some local App
# that accept only local subnet IPs, e.g you cannot access it
# via normal port forwarding like WAN:portFwd, instead
# it work's with ssh port fwd and then http://localhost:PortFwd

# Now, in order to make it work you should create 2 rules in Firewall NAT table.
# 1. Add normal dst-nat port forwarding
# 2. Add src-nat rule AFTER above one that should be something like that:

Chain: src-nat
Dst-address: App/Service LOCAL IP address, e.g 192.168.10.20
Proto: TCP (e.g)
Action: src-nat
To-address: this one should be the source IP that you want your packet to go out with.
Normally, this one should be a local router interface IP.
