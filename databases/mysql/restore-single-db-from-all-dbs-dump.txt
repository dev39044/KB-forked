# mysqldump output is just a set of SQL statements.
# You can provide the desired database in the command line and skip the commands against the other databases using:

mysql -D mydatabase -o mydatabase < dump.sql

# This will only execute the commands when mydatabase is in use


# ----
# Another option which is IMHO much safer, is to extract the DB from an --all-databases dump. Example

sed -n '/^-- Current Database: `dbname`/,/^-- Current Database: `/p' alldatabases.sql > output.sql
