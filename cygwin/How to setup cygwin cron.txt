-- Enter the value of CYGWIN for the daemon: [ ] ntsec

# USING WINDOWS SCHEDULER #
###########################

# I've spent a lot of time digging into it and was unable to make it work!
# Much quicker way of having scheduler is to use Windows Scheduler with bat files:

1. Create a bat file and add:

C:\cygwin64\bin\bash.exe /home/username/path/to/script.sh

2. Add $PATH:/cygdrive/c/cygwin64/bin in your *.sh script in order to have proper $PATH variable

3. Just set up when you want to run your scripts. That's it!
