# Here we'll document how to transfer one LV from server1 to server2 

# 1.First you need some packages
apt-get install pigz netcat pv -y

# 2. Create LV with same name and size

lvcreate -L <FIXED-SIZE-GB> -n <LV-NAME> <VG>

# 3. Create a snapshot of your source LV
 lvcreate -L 15G -s -n 04.may.2020-ok /dev/mapper/vg0-<LV>--disk

# 4. Then prepare you destination for receiving data from source server
nc -l -p <DEST-PORT> | dd bs=16M of=/dev/vg0/<LV-NAME>

# 5. Finally start transfering your source data 
pv -bretp /dev/vg0/<LV-NAME> | nc <IP/HOST> <DEST-PORT> -q 1


[ SECURE ]
# SSH reverse port fwd + dd + pv + nc

# 1. On your dst server start listening on a specific port
# and pipe input data to dd

nc -vlp 4444 | dd bs=16M of=/folder/file.img &

# 2. Create reverse port fwd-ing on destination server
# that points to your local port 4444
# Note here -R which is opposite of -L (local port fwd)
# -f put ssh in background, -N to not execute command,
# -T to not allocate tty, -n prevents reading from stdin (needed when in bg ) 

ssh -nNfTR 4444:localhost:4444 DST-SRV -p <PORT>

# 3. Now you have to have listening 127.0.0.1:4444 on your dst-srv
# Do not forget to check firewall on your receiving srv for not blocking
# data from interface -i lo !!!

# 4. Start transferring 

pv -bretp /dev/vg0/<LV-NAME> | nc localhost 4444 -q 1
