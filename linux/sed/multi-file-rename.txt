# If you wanna rename multiple file names check "rename" command or
# use for loop in the following way:

for i in your-file-names* ; mv -v "$i" "${i/your-file-names/your-new-file-names}"

# Above is true according to BASH rules:

${var/Pattern/Replacement}
First match of Pattern, within var replaced with Replacement.

If Replacement is omitted, then the first match of Pattern is replaced by nothing, that is, deleted.

${var//Pattern/Replacement}
Global replacement. All matches of Pattern, within var replaced with Replacement.

As above, if Replacement is omitted, then all occurrences of Pattern are replaced by nothing, that is, deleted.
