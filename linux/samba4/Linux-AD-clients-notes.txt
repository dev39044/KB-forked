1. You need to install the winbind and samba packages. The packages cifs-utils and smbclient are useful for mounting network shares and copying files.

apt-get install samba winbind cifs-utils smbclient krb5-user libpam-krb5

2. The first step in joining the Active Directory domain is to edit /etc/samba/smb.conf:

[global]
        security = ads
        realm = mydomain.ZZ
# Below parameter could contain entries with space separated, i.e ip addresses of other DCs. Note that their is some delay ~3-4secs. when the 1st DC is down.
        password server = 192.168.1.30 192.168.1.31
# note that workgroup is the 'short' domain name
        workgroup = mydomain
#       winbind separator = +
        idmap uid = 50000-60000
        idmap gid = 50000-60000
        winbind enum users = yes
        winbind enum groups = yes
        template homedir = /home/%D/%U
        template shell = /bin/bash
        client use spnego = yes
        client ntlmv2 auth = yes
        encrypt passwords = yes
        winbind use default domain = yes
        restrict anonymous = 2


3. Check your /etc/hosts file.

4. Edit /etc/krb5.conf file:

[logging]
        Default = FILE:/var/log/krb5.log

[libdefaults]
        ticket_lifetime = 24000
        clock-skew = 300
        default_realm = mydomain.ZZ
#       dns_lookup_realm = false
#       dns_lookup_kdc = true

[realms]
        mydomain.zz = {
                kdc = vg-dc01.mydomain.zz:88
		kdc = vg-dc02.mydomain.zz:88
                admin_server = vg-dc01.mydomain.zz:464
                default_domain = mydomain.zz        

}

[domain_realm]
        .server.com = mydomain.zz
        server.com = mydomain.zz


5. Test with kinit then klist to see if Kerberos works.

6. Stop winbind, restart samba, start winbind.

7. Join the domain:

	# net ads join

RESTART: Stop winbind, restart samba, start winbind AGAIN!

8. Test if you can see the users in AD:

	# wbinfo -u

9. Edit /etc/nsswitch.conf with:

passwd: compat winbind
group:  compat winbind
shadow: compat winbind

10. Run pam-auth-update in order to add needful entries in pam.d/* files]

11. Add this to /etc/pam.d/common-session

session required pam_unix.so
session required pam_mkhomedir.so umask=0022 skel=/etc/skel

12. Restart samba and winbind services

13. Test if you see passwd and groups in AD:

	# getent passwd
	# getent group

# EOF
