# You need to perform several commands
# To actually rename a volume group type:
vgrename vg0 vg4

# Now try to update grub
update-grub

# If above command fails, manually apply changes in grub.cfg.
# First check what's going on with the old vg0 name:
grep -i vg0 /boot/grub/grub.cfg

# Now use sed to apply changes at once:
sed -i 's/vg0/vg4/g' /boot/grub/grub.cfg

# Do the same for /etc/fstab

# Make sure /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume file contains:
RESUME=none

# Finally update initramfs
update-initramfs -u -k all
