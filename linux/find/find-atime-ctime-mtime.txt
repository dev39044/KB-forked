# Below is explanation of find *time arguments:
# When you use find -mtime +1 , it actually means that
# file should be modified at least 48h ago, where "+" means more than that. 

+0 == 24h+
+1 == 48h+
+2 == 72h+
+3 == 96h+
+4 == 120h+

0 == 0-24h between "now" and 24h time frame
1 == 24-48h
2 == 48-72h
3 == 72-96h

-mtime 4 , means that file modification date should be between 96 and 120h.
