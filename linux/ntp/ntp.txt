# VERY GOOD EXPLANATION OF NTP: http://www.h3c.com/portal/Technical_Support___Documents/Technical_Documents/Switches/H3C_S5120_Series_Switches/Configuration/Operation_Manual/H3C_S5120-SI_CG-Release_1101-6W105/201108/723597_1285_0.htm

# Requirements:
1. driftfile /var/lib/ntp/ntp.drift - used to calculate the offset.
2. server <hostname or ip address> iburst - check ntp.conf man page.
3. restrict - check http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ntp/html/accopt.html#restrict
4. TROUBLESHOOTING - check http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ntp/html/debug.html


- check /etc/services - there should be entry for ntp 123 service
- check firewall UDP --sport and --dport 123 !
- ping your ntp servers /skip dns problem/
- If the client time at startup happens to be more than 1000 s distant from NTP time, the daemon exits with a message to the system log directing the operator to manually set the time within 1000 s and restart. If the time is less than 1000 s but more than 128 s distant, a step correction occurs and the daemon restarts automatically!

# /etc/localtime and /etc/timezone ###

/etc/localtime is used to tell Linux the correct TIME 

It's much better to COPY instead to create a shortcut from /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Sofia to /etc/localtime.
Why? Well, because if in future you have to change the timezone again, you'll create a new shortcut to /etc/localtime and
will actually replace your previous timezone file, in this case SOFIA! Also /usr maybe mounted later than /etc.

/etc/timezone is used to tell the TIMEZONE i.e EUROPE/SOFIA where the locatime in SOFIA is taken from /etc/localtime.
