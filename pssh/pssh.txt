# If you want to execute single/multiple commands to multiple servers via ssh, check this out:

apt-get install pssh

# Create a shortcut for pssh as seems it's missing and you have to use the long parallel-ssh, uh.

ln -s /usr/bin/parallel-ssh /usr/bin/pssh

# Before you start, change in /etc/ssh/ssh_config these options:
StrictHostKeyChecking no
HashKnownHosts no

# When you use pssh, despite above ssh settings you'll still receive warnings about known_host files. Ignore them.
# If you want to use a script, then you have to 1st copy it to ALL servers you want to execute it. But check below workarounds.

# Examples: 

# This command will:
-A // ask for password, you can use RSA keys if you don't want to deal with passwords.
-i // will display stdout & stderr on your console. If you skip it, you'll get only [SUCCESS] or [FAILURE] status for every server.
-H // this is to specify single or multiple servers. You can use better option -h <srvlist.txt>
-o // create relative stout folder with <hostname> files for every server. This is for stdout. 
-e // same but for stderr.
-l // use specific username for login
"commands" // If you want to execute more that 1 remote command, you have to separate them with ; and quote them.
 
pssh -A -l root -i -H "deb1 deb2" -o stout -e sterr "echo hi; hostname ; cat /etc/resolv.conf"
