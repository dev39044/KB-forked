### Automounter is a program for auto mounting different file systems/devices ON DEMAND. (like Win Mapped drive)

1. which automounter // this will show you where LSB executable is located.
2. There is a daemon autofs who is using control files.
3. Control files are located in /etc and are with names:

- auto.misc // this file is an automounter map which shows what should be mounted.
- auto.net // this is executable script - open it for more info
- auto.master // this is the main file which controls mounting of different FSs.
- auto.smb // this is executable script  - open it for more info

4. Main usage of autofs is to mount FS/devices on demand. E.g. Windows has mapped drives,
which when are inaccessible slow donw the whole pc trying to search for this drive.
With autofs (/etc/sysconfig/autofs is the config file for RHEL) you have option to autodismount
mounted FS/device for period of inactivity.

EXAMPLE:

1. You have configured in auto.misc file to map automatically cdrom device.
So, when you open /misc/cdrom you will see content of inserted CD in cdrom device.

2. If you've set up your home dir (/home/val) to automount in /misc/val, then when you
access /misc/val you'll see your home files.
