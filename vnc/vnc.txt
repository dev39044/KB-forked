### Setting up VNC server on RedHat 6

1. Install:

yum install tigervnc-server

2. vi /etc/sysconfig/vncserver

- in this file you should uncomment lines where to define display:user pair.
Example below shows that diplay number 1 for user val will be active.
This means that Xvnc(this is part of vncserver service) will listed on 5901 port.
If you specify display number 3, then port will be 5903. BUT REMEMBER - VNC communication
is NOT SECURE. You could make it as pointed in the file, vnc to listen on localhost on port 590X,
then use SSH + portforwarding ;)

VNCSERVERS="1:val"
VNCSERVERARGS[1]="-geometry 800x600"

3. Run "chkconfig vncserver on" -- in order VNC service to be active on boot.

3.1. Now run "vncpasswd" command WITH THE USER which will be used for vnc logging (to generate vnc password for this account).
Enter it twice. This will create a file in ~/val/.vnc/passwd

4. Run "vncserver" command WITH THE USER which will be used for vnc logging.
This will create a few vnc files in ~/val/.vnc folder and will start Xvnc process.
By default this should create display:1 pair. If you run it again, this will create display:2 pair
and you will have few Xvnc processes started on different ports. (ports 5901, 5902 etc.)

5. Run "netstat -nlp | grep -i vnc" to check listening configuration.

6. Now you are ready to connect from vncviewer client:

vncviewer <your vncserver IP>:1 -- the last digit 1 tells vncviewer client to connect on port 5901 (1st server display).

7. Do not forget to enable vnc port on server firewall :) 

-- that's all.
