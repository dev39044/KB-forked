1. When you create PTR DNS zone, make it 56.168.192.in-addr.arpa instead of 0.56.168.192.in-addr.arpa ... MENTION THE ZERO ....it shouldn't be there if the mask is /24.
2. When you miss a DNS record for a Windows client, try to run from the client itself command: ipconfig /registerdns .
3. For linux clients the command: net ads dns register  , will work only when you have (TSIG good configuration ..no idea how to make it yet) or in AD DC smb.conf file enabled
parameter: allow dns updates = nonsecure . As you can see, this is not a good to be enabled

# To see all records in a dns zone use this command:

samba-tool dns query deb1 mydomain.local @ ALL

# To add an A DNS record, do the following:

samba-tool dns add deb1 mydomain.local munin A 192.168.56.30

# To add a PTR record in Samba DNS, do the following:

samba-tool dns add `hostname` 1.168.192.in-addr.arpa 36 PTR vg-srv1.mydomain.zz

# To add a NS record in PTR zone, do the following:

samba-tool dns add `hostname` 1.168.192.in-addr.arpa . NS vg-dc02.mydomain.zz
