Setup SYSVOL replication
Sadly samba 4 doesn't support replication of the SYSVOL directory yet so we need to address this. The way I chose to achieve a bidirectional synchronization is with "unison". Required for this to work is that both server can use SSH commands without password. I won't write the steps how to setup authorized keys authentication for SSH. Just setup SSH for the root user to connect to each other servers.

Install unison on both servers

aptitude install unison
On the SDC create following configuration file

samba-sdc
nano /root/.unison/default.prf

root@vg-dc02:~# cat /root/.unison/default.prf 
# Unison preferences file
root = ssh://vg-dc01//opt/mydomain/samba/var/locks/sysvol
root = /opt/mydomain/samba/var/locks/sysvol
batch = true
owner = true
auto = true
logfile = /var/log/unison.log
Just start unison to see if it works

unison
If it does , create a cronjob that syncs every minute

# set MAILTO env var to NULL in crontab. This prevents some unwanted emails.
MAILTO=""
