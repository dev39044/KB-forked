1. The following is only required on @@@Domain Member Servers@@@ and not on Domain Controllers!

Add the following to your [global] section of your smb.conf:
     vfs objects = acl_xattr
     map acl inherit = Yes
     store dos attributes = Yes

2. SeDiskOperatorPrivilege:

To configure share permissions, you need an account with „SeDiskOperatorPrivilege“. To grant this privilege, e.g. to the „Domain Admin“ group, run the following command on your AD member server(s):
# net rpc rights grant 'SAMDOM\Domain Admins' SeDiskOperatorPrivilege -Uadministrator

Existing privileges can be reviewed by
# net rpc rights list accounts -Uadministrator

3. Adding a new share:

Create a folder that you want to share
# mkdir -p /srv/samba/Demo/
Add a new share to your smb.conf (using no other configuration parameters when first setting up a share is highly recommended!):
[Demo]
     path = /srv/samba/Demo/
     read only = no
Reload Samba:
# smbcontrol all reload-config

4. To reset already applied ACLs:

# setfacl -b /path/to/share
# setfacl -b /path/to/share/*
# setfacl -R -m default:group:domain\ admins:rwx /path/to/share
