### LEGACY ###

BIOS support msdos partition tables.
msdos part table limits the max partition size to 2TB.
msdos part table allows only 4 partition, which you can extend by using extended/logical partitions.



### NEW AGE ### 

GPT part table supports partitions with size a few ZB (zetabytes) .... huuuuge number!
GPT by default allows 128 partitions in a disk.
UEFI will supersedes BIOS. UEFI use GPT by default.
You can have a partition formated with gpt part table with no issues. However if you
want to boot an OS from gpt formated partition this is a different thing.
Note that BIOS/GPT booting is not supported on Windows and on Linux is not recommended as well.
The right combination to boot from gpt partition is to use the new firmware UEFI.

GRUB-legacy v0.97 - DO NOT support gpt partitions. Instead use GRUB2 or v1.98 which have this support.

# TOOLS:

fdisk, sfdisk, cfdisk - all of them DO NOT support gpt partitions.
parted - support gpt partitions.
