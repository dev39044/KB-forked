# You can automate a lot of things in Mikrotik
# 1st generate 1024 dsa key (this is the max bits by design!) using below command:
# Don't use passphrase
ssh-keygen -t dsa 

# Then copy the dsa.pub key in your mik board using:

scp -P <port> user@ip:/

# VERY IMPORTANT! 
# Once you assign an ssh key to your user account, you CANNOT log in with password!
# So consider using separate account for automation ...
# After coping the pub key, log into the mik router and type:
/user ssh-keys import user=<USER ACCOUNT> public-key-file=<usually dsa.pub>
