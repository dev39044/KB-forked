1. In order to browse UX directory, i.e. list files, folders... you need -r permission 
2. If you want to modify any file or subfolder, you need -w permission.
3. If you want to traverse a folder, you need -x permission.

Examples:

# 1. You want to list and traverse a folder named Marketing. 
This folder is located like that:

/FILES/TEAM/Marketing 

let's suppose that you want to share Marketing folder. In order users
to be able to browse and traverse it, you need to set up +rx permissions
on at least one use that has these rights. Usually it is group others.

IF /FILES or TEAM folders lack +rx permissions, users cannot browse or traverse
folder Marketing!!!

# 2. If you have a Samba file server, DO NOT FORGET to put these options in smb.conf file:

create mask = 0770
force create mode = 0660
directory mask = 0750
force directory mode = 0750

# they are used to force all new files and folders to lack permissions for others group: o-rx
# This is needed because, when you usually give a user permissions to some main folder + sub folders and files,
# if you have these o+rx permissions, then that user is able to read A LOT MORE information that you have expected!!!
# You could put all needed permissions in acl groups, set acl defaults as well and that's it!
