Authentication (signing - RSA, DSA, ElGamal signing)

======================
Integrity:
- hash : hash is not keyed (protected) - SHA0,1,2, MD5
- MAC : MAC is used for message authentication, and is a symmetrically keyed primitive - hmac-sha1, hmac-md5, hmac-sha1-96
MAC is used mainly for integrity AND authenticity, i.e you know that the message you receive is from exactly userA. It's
based on secret key.

======================
Encryption:
- Symmetric : AES, Blowfish, DES, Triple DES, Serpent, Twofish
- asymmetric: RSA, Diffie–Hellman key exchange, ElGamal encryption

Examples of protocols using asymmetric key algorithms include:
GPG, an implementation of OpenPGP
Internet Key Exchange
PGP
ZRTP, a secure VoIP protocol
Secure Socket Layer, now codified as the IETF standard Transport Layer Security (TLS)
SILC
SSH
Timekoin
Bitcoin

=======================
Digital certificate (public key certificate):
- What makes up a digital certificate (DC)?

The electronic files that comprise the digital certificate contain:
The person's name
An email address
A serial number
A public key
An expiration date (certificates are valid for five years)
A digital signature

- What is the purpose of DC?
	- signing (authentication)
	- encryption
	- no-repudiation


- X.509 specifies, amongst other things, standard formats for public key certificates, certificate revocation lists, attribute certificates, and a certification path validation algorithm.
