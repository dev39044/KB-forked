# We suppose you have already setup Xen and /etc/xen-tools/xen-tools.conf file. 
# Above file is needed for xen-create-image tool which in turn generates configurations
# usually in /etc/xen or if configured in /etc/xen/configs/*.cfg

# Note: DO NOT simply copy/paste <host>.cfg files. These files are generated automatically.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Below are all steps needed to create a new linux vm on Xen host:

1. Verify you have /etc/xen-tools/xen-tools.conf file configured appropriately.
Do not create lvm partitions in advance. These will be created automatically for you
if you have chosen to use lvm of course :)

2. Use tool xen-create-image with most common args like:
	 xen-create-image 			\
		--dist=jessie 			\
		--hostname=<HOSTNAME> 		\
		--ip=<ADDRESS>	 		\
		--size=<MAIN-VOL>		\
		--swap=2G			\
		--memory=4G			\
		--vcpu=2			\

3. After successful vm installation/image creation, you can run it like that:

xl create -f /etc/xen/configs/<vm>.cfg
