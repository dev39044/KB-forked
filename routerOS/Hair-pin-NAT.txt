This link explains everything, about accessing LAN services from LAN via WAN IP.

The point is to make an additional SNAT rule, like this:

/ip firewall nat
add chain=srcnat src-address=192.168.1.0/24 \
 dst-address=192.168.1.2 protocol=tcp dst-port=80 \
 out-interface=LAN action=masquerade
 
 Simply said, the problem comes from this:
 
 Client:	192.168.1.10
 Web-srv:	192.168.1.50
 Mik-local:	192.168.1.1
 Mik-wan:	10.20.20.205
 
 So, when client send a request to Web-srv via WAN IP, we have the following chart:
 
 SRC				DEST
 192.168.1.10		10.20.20.205:80
 192.168.1.10		192.168.1.50:80
 all seems OK, except when packet need to go back.
 
 192.168.1.50		192.168.1.10 - HERE IS THE PROBLEM. Client expects an reply from Mik-wan, 
 not directly from Web-srv. To overcome this, you need above SNAT rule.
