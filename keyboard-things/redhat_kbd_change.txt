If you want to change the KBD layout/map get into below file:

vi /etc/sysconfig/keyboard

KEYTABLE="us" or e.g "de"
LAYOUT="us" or e.g "de"

If you want to change system language:

command echo $LANG will show you current language set.
This could be changed in /etc/sysconfig/i18n file,
but you could search for this file with:

grep -iR utf /etc/sysconfig/
