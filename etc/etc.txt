/etc/profile:
- system wide config file. 
- executed for ALL shells, instead for BASH only.
- after reading this file, system continue with ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile, in that order, and reads and executes commands from the FIRST one that exists and is readable.

~/.bash_profile:
- note that in most of the cases this file invokes ~/.bashrc which invokes /etc/bashrc or /etc/bash.bashrc

~/.bashrc:
- When  an  interactive  shell that is NOT a login shell is started, bash reads and executes commands from ~/.bashrc, if that file exists.
