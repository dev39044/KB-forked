Just replace content of your original /etc/fail2ban with this folder.
It's a working config from kobila! 

DO NOT FORGET TO RESTART rsyslog or syslogd if you have changed your local timezone!!!
Check if your current server time matches your log daemon time ... if these are not in sync
fail2ban will fail as well.
