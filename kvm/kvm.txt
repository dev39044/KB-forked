1. Installation:

You need to install 4 groups using apt-get install or yum groupinstall:

yum groupinfo Virtualization // this will give you the list of pkgs in this group
yum groupinstall <group name> // this will install ALL pkgs in mentioned group.

2. You need to check that libvirtd daemon is configured to start at boot and it's running.

3. Check that kvm modules are loaded at boot time:

lsmod kvm // should give you info that kvm module is loaded as well as kvm_intel or kvm_amd.

NOTE: kvm_intel or amd will be loaded ONLY if your host supports Virtualization extentions, 
i.e: 

grep -Ei (vmx|svm) /proc/cpuinfo  // this should show some output if you have needed virt capabilities.

4. In order to manage VM via GUI, install virt-manager.
