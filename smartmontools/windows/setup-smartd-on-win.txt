# Things to download:
# - smarmontools
# - blat (smtp server for windows)
# - stunnel (you need it if your smtp server require ssl/tls - gmail does.)


# SMARTMONTOOLS

1. Install package smartmontools-XXXXX.win32-setup.exe. To install smartd service,
go to Windows Start menu > smartmontools folder > smartd examples, and click on 
the bat fie "Service install, smartd.log, 10min".

2. Go to C:\Program Files\smartmontools\bin and edit smartd.conf.
Put there:

/dev/sda -a -m <YOUR-DEST-EMAIL> -M diminishing 

Try before that with "test" instead of "diminishing".

NOTE: You must have blat and stunnel already setup in order to successfully sent email with "-M test" !

# Setting up blat

1. Download blat from https://sourceforge.net/projects/blat/files/
2. Extract it in C:\Windows and C:\Windows\System32 (you need to have it in PATH var)
3. Open cmd.exe and type: 

	blat -install -server 127.0.0.1 -f <YOUR-FROM-EMAIL-ADDR> -u <USERNAME> -pw <PASS>

This have to create a reg entry in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Public Domain\Blat with info like this:


Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Public Domain\Blat]
"SMTP Server"="127.0.0.1"
"SMTP Port"="25"
"Try"="1"
"Login"="XXXXXXXX" (encrypted)
"Pwd"="XXXXXXXXXX" (encrypted)
"Sender"="XXXXXXX@gmail.com"
  
4. Now in order above default blat profile to work you need stunnel to provide SSL/TLS capability.

# Setting up stunnel

1. Download and install stunnel from stunnel.org
2. During install you'll be asked where file to be extracted. Note that you might need not to change that path
in order the service (in system tray) to work.
3. When you see stunnel in System tray, right click on it and edit configuration.
There you need only these lines:

[gmail-smtp]
client = yes
accept = 127.0.0.1:25
connect = smtp.gmail.com:465
verifyChain = yes
CAfile = ca-certs.pem
checkHost = smtp.gmail.com
OCSPaia = yes

4. Save and reload config.
5. Now you should be able to send test email using "-M test" agrument in smartd.conf
