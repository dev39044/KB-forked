# If you have anacron installed then check /etc/anacrontab
# In Debian /etc/crontab is replaced by /etc/anacrontab. 

7	10	cron.weekly	run-parts --report /etc/cron.weekly

# above record in /etc/anacrontab means that cron.weekly will be executed
# every 7 days with delay of 10 minutes. Anacron works as checking modification times: 

cat /var/spool/anacron/cron.weekly 
20200412

# Hours don't matter, only date is important.
# So if you want /etc/cron.weekly to run at specific day, you can modify spool anacron file
# so that it matches your wish after 7 or X days.
